When I started learning Maths the most fundament thing we were taught first were the Axioms. These were the fundamental and unquestionable truths based on which the remainder of Mathematics was built on. People very often mistake certain derivations to be facts or truths, but they are mere abstractions of orignal truth and conditions of the time they were observed in, and if conditions change the abstractions change too but the axioms stay the same forever. This is famously known as "first principle thinking".

I discovered earlier [meditation](/2023/07/12/on-meditation.html) was one such observation I kept coming back to again and again, it was prevelant in almost everything. So is this another derivative or is it an axiom of life? It feels like a derivative, because you only need to reach the state of Samadhi.

I guess it would be easier to eliminate things that are temporary until I reach what's permanent.

Right off the bat, lot of materialistic things are obviously temporary. Knowledge may seem like permanent, but knowledge itself gets outdated and rots on it's own unless you keep appending to it. A lot of emotions are temporary, happiness comes and goes, so does pain. People who make us feel these emotions are temporary too, time changes them, they can leave from our lives or die, but some of the emotions they made us feel can linger forever in our memories, especially [pragma](/2023/06/28/on-love.html), until we eventually die too taking those memories with us.

Planets die, stars die, oceans terraform into land and land disintegrates back to oceans. Even ideas only last as long as they are being thought upon.

The only thing that seems permanent is evanescence, and evanescence itself is just a derivative of death. Might sound like a debby downer here, but this is the most positive thing I could think of! If death is the only permanance then the only thing it can give importance to is existence of life itself. A hot summer day keeps me yearning for the clouds and the rain and the only reason I miss the Sun is because of the cloudy weather in Tokyo :D

The permanence of death is creating reason for life and the living üñ§
